This is a website intended to show Kellogg courses and allow students to rate and comment on them (basically just like our CTEC system). The need arose out of a student pain point that we can't see CTEC comments and that having qualitative comments, in addition to a quantitiatve score would be helpful. The website is very MVP right now (e.g., doesn't show the various course-professor-section combinations)
